## Overview

PhiloSloppy is a charming project dedicated to refining a cutting-edge LLM model for engaging philosophical dialogues. Our journey involves three delightful phases:

2) **Fine Tuning:** ✨ Embark on a quest to fine-tune Mistral AI's marvelous Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model, boasting a whopping 7 billion parameters! 🚀 Witness our model blossom into a conversational virtuoso, all set for philosophical ponderings.

3) **Deployment:** 🌐 Watch as our refined model gracefully takes its place on the digital stage! Accessible via a serverless API, our model eagerly awaits to engage in spirited discussions, easily accessible with a simple python command.
